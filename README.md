# deep-learning-BLE-ranging
 In this project, we examine the work of Zand et
 al. [1] for high-accuracy ranging with Bluetooth Low Energy
 (BLE). First, a frequency-hopping phase-based ranging solution
 conforming to the BLE standard in the 2.4 GHz frequency band
 is presented. Next, we investigate the impact of crystal offset
 and phase-noise on the ranging accuracy. We extend the work in
 [1] by mathematically examining the error introduced by device
 mobility in BLE ranging and investigating a multi-path and
 Rayleigh fading channel model. Further, we introduce a novel
 residual learning technique for synthetically improving 
 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) before ranging via subspace decomposition
 methods (MUSIC). Our proposed deep neural network (DNN)
 approach reduces localization error on both AWGN fixed fading
 and AWGN Rayleigh fading channels in multi-path scenarios.
 Simulation results for the various techniques and scenarios are
 presented and discussed demonstrating the superior performance
 of our novel methods.
